# Project Core Backend
 
**Warning - This project is still in development and far from finished**<br>
**Name is subject to change**<br>

## The Idea
With this project I want to be able to create a platform for companies or schools.<br>
Employers can invite their employees and assign tasks.<br>
Tasks can be chosen with or without a deadline.<br>
Employees can then fulfill the tasks and upload their finished assignment for the employer.<br>
The employer then can rate or verify the assignment.<br>

## Why I Started This Project
I am still a student and during the COVID-19 outbreak I had to experience a lot of downtime with similar
services that are being used by our school.<br>
Frustrated enough I wanted to learn more about backend and REST-API development and started all of this.<br>
Hopefully I can dedicate enough time to this project to either make it available for companies/schools in my local area
or even for the rest of the world.<br>

## Extra Information
The biggest goal I want to achieve is protecting private data to the best of my abilities.<br>
This means that employees will **never** be able to read sensitive information of their co-workers.<br>
Employers will only receive the **absolute minimum** of private information they require.<br>
The employer can **choose** which information he wants to make publicly visible.<br>
